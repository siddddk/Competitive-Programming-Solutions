# Repository Description

Welcome to my Codeforces Solutions and Practice Problems Repository!

This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces contests organized into folders by contest type (Educational or Round), along with additional practice problems I've solved.

Explore the folders to find solutions in C++ (.cpp files) named after problem codes or names. The 'Practice' directory holds solutions to various practice problems covering different difficulty levels and topics.

Happy coding!
