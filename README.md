# Competitive-Programming-Solutions

Welcome to my Codeforces Solutions and Practice Problems Repository!

This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces contests organized into folders by contest type (educational or normal rounds), along with additional practice problems I've solved in my competitive programming journey.

Explore the folders to find solutions in C++ (.cpp files) named after problem names on Codeforces. The 'Practice' directory holds solutions to various practice problems covering different difficulty levels and topics.

Happy coding!
